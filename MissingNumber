Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

public class Solution {
    public int MissingNumber(int[] nums) {
        int total = (nums.Length * (nums.Length+1))/2;
        for(int i = 0; i<nums.Length; i++){
            total = total - nums[i];
        }
        return total;
    }
}
